<h1>ALEXANDRA'S MOVIE WATCH LIST</h1>
<H2>My watch list for 2025</H2>
<hr />

<h3>Lucifer</h3>
<p>I love Lucifer's character because he portrayed someone different compared to what the world knows about him. <br /> He is funny, caring and makes you want to sin a little bit.
</p>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<p>I love Wednesday Aadams character because she was fierced, cared but acted like she didn't. <br /> I also love her obessesion with black while her friend Enid has the complete opposite personality
</p>

<h3>Vampire diaries</h3>
<p>I love Damon's character because he is just completely evil. If things doesn't go his way, he acts like a child and goes on a killing rampage. <br /> Although he feels remorse sometimes, but he tries his best not to show it and portrays the typical Damon that everyone hates.
